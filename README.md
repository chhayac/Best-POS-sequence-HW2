# POS Tagging: Viterbi Decoding
Viterbi Decoding Matrix

# Description
For the above bigram HMM POS tagger, calculate the Viterbi Matrix for the sentence: "learning changes throughly" using the following emission probabilities:

P(learning|V) = 0.003
P(changes|V) = 0.004
P(throughly|Adv) = 0.002
P(learning|N) = 0.001
P(changes|N) = 0.003

Calculate Viterbi Matrix and the values for the sentence "learning changes throughly" along with the Output of the tagger.
